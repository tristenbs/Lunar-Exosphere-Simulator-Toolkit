# Lunar-Exosphere-Simulator-Toolkit
# DESCRIPTION TODO

The Lunar Exosphere Simulator can be thought of as a generalized subroutine that can be
incorporated into a Monte Carlo program that, in turn, collects statistical data on the
behavior of any neutral atomic or molecular species in the lunar exosphere. The basic task
performed LExS is to track a free atom or molecule through a sequence of r
andom ballistic trajectories and intervening encounters with the lunar surface. The ballistic part of the
code includes the perturbation the lunar gravitational potential due to the earth and sun,
resonant scatter of solar photons, charge exchange reactio
ns with solar wind and
terrestrial magnetosphere ions, photoionization, photodissociation, and escape.
Simulation of the encounters of atoms or molecules with the lunar surface amounts to
random migration in a computer generated, fairycastlelike structure of loosely packed
soil grains
